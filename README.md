# Simple-Laravel-project
This project provided a solid introduction to backend development and database fundamentals.
It was my first hands-on experience with PHP and Laravel, developed during the Winter Training at the Information Technology Institute (ITI).
The project helped me understand database design, MySQL integration, and server-side application flow
